        <h3>1. Ambitious</h3>
        <p>
          Priyanka Chopra seems like an actress who has decided to hitch her
          wagon to a star. She is ambitious and headstrong. When it comes to a
          career, she has goals and wants to achieve them; success matters more
          to her than fame. In an interview to TIMES 100 Achiever’s list,
          Priyanka Chopra said that she doesn’t want to be called an actor or
          star or have a label, she just wants to be someone who achieves her
          goals and become the best version of herself.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Style</h3>
        <p>
          Priyanka Chopra sure is a style icon when it comes to Fashion and Fad,
          be it on the cover of TIME magazine or the way she walks down the red
          carpet in her stunning white strapless gown. Her gorgeous attires and
          appearances have always left people dumbstruck. Her beauty never fades
          be it on her face or her heart.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Self Confidence</h3>
        <p>
          The woman exudes confidence. In a male dominating society where women
          have been denounced in every field, where one gender is inferior, she
          has preceded all the male actors. She has achieved a lot and has set
          an example for all the women. Her audacious attitude has helped her in
          her accomplishments. The Quantico star has never been scared of the
          disrespectful media coverage or controversies; she always speaks out
          with conviction and feels. Confidence plays a vital role in individual
          success. Many a time we lack self-confidence and self-esteem because
          we think negatively about ourselves.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Hard Working</h3>
        <p>
          Priyanka Chopra is certainly very laborious, diligent, and committed
          towards her work, she has undergone months of vigorous training and
          work out for her roles in Mary Kom and as an FBI agent in Quantico and
          never surrendered and that’s what makes her strong and determined. You
          must have heard that hard work is the key to success. Still, we don’t
          do hard work.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Old Is Better</h3>
        <p>
          The thirty-four-year-old international star is the epitome of a truly
          inspiring personality. She followed her dreams despite huge failures.
          Priyanka always tells people to follow their dreams no matter what,
          never to surrender to hopelessness when things start to fall apart.
          Making her mark in both Bollywood and Hollywood is a long row to hoe
          and she’s making wonderful progress. Season 1 of Quantico has received
          many positive reviews globally and season 2 is on the run. As we all
          know age is just a number. We can do whatever we want and our age
          cannot stop us from doing that.
        </p>
        <h3>6. Venturesome Personality</h3>
        <p>
          The Padma Shri winner is a venturesome personality. She has trod on
          new and riskier paths every time she has played a character out of her
          comfort zone or acted as a brown FBI agent in an American crime drama
          series or producing her singles “In My City” and “Exotic” with
          Grammy-winning artists, William and Pitbull. One must be energetic to
          become a venturesome personality. When we want to do a lot of things
          then we must have the energy to pursue it.
        </p>
        <h3>7. Know-How To Tackle Situations</h3>
        <p>
          She tackles whatever comes in her way be it the controversies, the
          public opinion, or working in Hollywood or music or fashion industry,
          and she has been persistent and adaptable and left her mark wherever
          she has been.
        </p>
        <h3>8. Creativeness</h3>
        <p>
          Priyanka Chopra is undeniably creative, the way she plans, she
          analyses herself and even tries to fit in an uncomfortable and
          demanding role, she makes it her own and enacts it in a unique way.
          Her personality reflects softness. In many interviews, Chopra has
          firmly responded that she wants to break all the stereotypes, be it
          racism or gender biases, and she took steps, has proven herself now
          and then for instance in ‘Fashion’ which was a movie about young
          female models or a brown girl playing the protagonist in an American
          TV series. She totally does it out of the box.
        </p>
        <h3>9. Kindness</h3>
        <p>
          Not only is she playing her cards in Hollywood and Bollywood,
          impressing her fans in the entertainment world but she is also
          empathetic and compassionate and stands out for social causes like
          child rights, education, gender biases and is also a philanthropist
          and believes in helping the needy. In 2010, UNICEF appointed her as
          the goodwill ambassador of Child rights.
        </p>
        <h3>10. Self Explorer</h3>
        <p>
          The global star is a self- explorer, she not only knows her strengths
          and weaknesses but works towards them, explores her potential, what
          paths to choose, sets high goals and dreams, and just embarks on the
          journey of achieving them. She has experimented in various fields of
          industries, be it fashion, Bollywood, Hollywood, music, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>11. Fearless</h3>
        <p>
          Priyanka’s fearlessness was evident right from the beginning of her
          career. From playing negative roles at the start of her career as she
          did in the movie Aitraaz to enacting the role of Alex Parrish, an FBI
          agent, the protagonist of the American TV series Quantico, the actor
          was critically acclaimed for accepting challenging roles.
